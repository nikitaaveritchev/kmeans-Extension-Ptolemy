## Draft
We aim to conduct execution time tests in the future, but 
Actual execution times are thus hard to reproduce and depend on how much time a researcher spends on optimizing the competing and their own d
While 
In essence, a difference in execution times can have multiple reasons: 

we have a strong incentive to optimize our new algorithm This problem concerns objectivity and 



seems to be dataset-dependent (most strongly on the dimensionality and number of clusters $k$).


This claim is not entirely unfounded, as the popularity of Elkan's algorithm shows, but a full paper would neccesitate a full comparison.

 Our expectations is that the actual speedups will depend strongly on the dataset, requireing some manner of prediction heuristic so can be chosen when it actually 


Ptolemaic bounds often improve results, but it is not clear how and when this does happen (might depend on dataset
