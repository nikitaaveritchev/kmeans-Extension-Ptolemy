## todo
- check if all criticism is included
- create and test makefile to run code and build paper
- add to github actions

## done
- shorten paper to fit the page limit
- fig 1: larger font, b/w readability [in the code part]
- check that local repo and overleaf are synced [2025-01-08]
- future work: execution time measurements
- elaborate why execution time isn't helpful here
- eq 2 typo: summand
- the speedup is "Elkan/ours", not the other way around!
