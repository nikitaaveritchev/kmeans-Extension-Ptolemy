    abstract = {This paper discusses a new family of bounds for use in
                similarity search, related to those used in metric indexing, but
                based on Ptolemy's inequality, rather than the metric axioms.
                Ptolemy's inequality holds for the well-known Euclidean distance,
                but is also shown here to hold for quadratic form metrics in
                general, with Mahalanobis distance as an important special case.
                The inequality is examined empirically on both synthetic and
                real-world data sets and is also found to hold approximately,
                with a very low degree of error, for important distances such as
                the angular pseudometric and several Lp norms. Indexing
                experiments are performed on several data sets, demonstrating a
                highly increased filtering power when using certain forms of
                Ptolemaic filtering, compared to existing, triangular methods. It
                is also shown that combining the Ptolemaic and triangular
                filtering can lead to better results than using either approach
                on its own.},

    abstract = {Metric indexing is the state of the art in general
                distance-based retrieval. Relying on the triangular inequality,
                metric indexes achieve significant online speed-up beyond a
                linear scan. Recently, the idea of Ptolemaic indexing was
                introduced, which substitutes Ptolemy's inequality for the
                triangular one, potentially yielding higher efficiency for the
                distances where it applies. In this paper we have adapted several
                metric indexes to support Ptolemaic indexing, thus establishing a
                class of Ptolemaic access methods (PtoAM). In particular, we
                include Ptolemaic Pivot tables, Ptolemaic PM-Trees and the
                Ptolemaic M-Index. We also show that the most important and
                promising family of distances suitable for Ptolemaic indexing is
                the signature quadratic form distance, an adaptive similarity
                measure which can cope with flexible content representations of
                multimedia data, among other things. While this distance has
                shown remarkable qualities regarding the search effectiveness,
                its high computational complexity underscores the need for
                efficient search methods. We show that these distances are
                Ptolemaic metrics and present a study where we apply Ptolemaic
                indexing methods on real-world image databases, resolving exact
                queries nearly four times as fast as the state-of-the-art metric
                solution, and up to three orders of magnitude times as fast as
                sequential scan.},
